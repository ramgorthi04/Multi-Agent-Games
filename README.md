# Research Question

**Utilizing multi-model communication to detect and combat deceptive text, particularly in the context of misinformation spread**\
This research project is funded (API credits) by the OpenAI Researcher Access Program
## Research Steps

1. **Construct a Multi-LM Environment**
   - Use multiple language models (LMs) to simulate various perspectives and interactions.

2. **Training Participant LMs**
   - Train the LMs using transcribed Mafia game recordings to understand deceptive and truthful communication patterns.

3. **Generalization to Real-life Scenarios**
   - Apply the trained LMs to real-life misinformation scenarios to test their effectiveness in identifying and combating deceptive text.

## Evaluation

- **Comparison with Game Results**
  - Evaluate the performance of the LMs by comparing their outputs to the outcomes of Mafia games.

- **Human or Other LM Judgments**
  - Assess the accuracy of the LMs' predictions by comparing them to judgments made by humans or other language models.
